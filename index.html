  const numbers = [[question1, answer1], [question2, answer2], [question3, answer3]];<br>
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {<br>
    console.log(`Question: ${numbers[i][0]}`);<br>
    const userAnswer = readlineSync.question('Your answer: ');<br>
    if (userAnswer === numbers[i][1]) console.log('Correct!');<br>
    else if (userAnswer !== numbers[i][1]) return console.log(`${userAnswer} is wrong answer ;(. Correct answer was ${numbers[i][1]}. \nLet's try again, ${userName}!`);<br>
